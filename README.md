The backend:
- does user authentication,
- allows to add grades, assignments, create new classrooms, etc.
- provides a timetable creation tool (doesn't work well on mobile due to problems with javascript)

The frontend:
- uses bootstrap to make the page look nice,
- uses modals to make the pake look even nicer,
- uses javascript to pass data to forms,
